		<Title>CVE-2021-44228 Log4j - Replace log4j-core-2.x.jar with log4j-core-{{version}}.jar - Universal</Title>
		<Description><![CDATA[
This task will run replace log4j-core-2.x.jar with log4j-core-{{version}}.jar<p>
<P>This Task requires a prior execution of one of the Log4jscan tasks, currently linked at <br>

&nbsp;(be sure to check for the latest version).</P>
<P>Where the Scan Task found log4j-core.2.x.jar, this Task will rename that file to log4j-core-2.x.jar-disabled, and replace the original file with log4j-core-{{version}}.jar.</P>
<P> Note that only files matching the log4j-core-2.x.jar format are replaced.  This task does not replace files that were renamed or log4j-1.x versions.</p>
<P> Follow this task by re-executing one of the scans listed above to ensure the issues have been remediated</p>
<P>The original filename will be retained for better compatibility with existing configuration files.</P>
<P>This operation does carry risk, as it is difficult to predict how replacing the JAR file might affect the larger application.&nbsp; No warranty expressed, use at your own risk.</P>
