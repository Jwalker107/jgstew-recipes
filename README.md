# jgstew-recipes

AutoPkg recipes which anyone can use from [JGStew](https://github.com/jgstew).

Where possible recipes will be in YAML format for better cross platform support at the expense of requiring AutoPkg 2.3+

Currently has a copy of `prefetch_from_dictionary.py` from https://github.com/jgstew/bigfix_prefetch/blob/master/prefetch_from_dictionary.py until it is turned into a proper published module.
